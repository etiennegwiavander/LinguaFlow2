# Deployment Checklist - Password Reset Feature

## ‚úÖ Pre-Deployment Verification

### Build Status
- [x] Production build successful (`npm run build`)
- [x] TypeScript compilation passed
- [x] All routes properly generated
- [x] No build errors or warnings (except SWC minifier deprecation)

### New Routes Added
- [x] `/auth/forgot-password` (6.41 kB) - Password reset request form
- [x] `/auth/reset-password` (7.46 kB) - Password reset form with token validation

### Code Quality
- [x] Debug logs only show in development mode
- [x] Production-ready error handling
- [x] Proper TypeScript types
- [x] Security best practices implemented

### Authentication Flow
- [x] Auth context updated to handle reset flow
- [x] Unprotected routes include new password reset pages
- [x] Session management prevents auto-login during reset
- [x] Proper token validation and cleanup

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Netlify Configuration
- [x] `netlify.toml` properly configured
- [x] Next.js plugin enabled
- [x] Security headers in place
- [x] Build command: `npm run build`
- [x] Publish directory: `.next`

### 2. Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in Netlify:
- [x] `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- [x] `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- [x] Any other required environment variables

### 3. Deploy Command
```bash
# If using Netlify CLI
netlify deploy --prod

# Or push to main branch for auto-deployment
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement secure password reset functionality"
git push origin main
```

## üîç Post-Deployment Testing

### Critical Path Testing
1. **Forgot Password Flow**
   - [ ] Navigate to `/auth/login`
   - [ ] Click "Forgot password?" link
   - [ ] Verify redirect to `/auth/forgot-password`
   - [ ] Enter email and submit
   - [ ] Check for success message

2. **Reset Password Flow**
   - [ ] Check email for reset link
   - [ ] Click reset link
   - [ ] Verify redirect to `/auth/reset-password` (not login)
   - [ ] Verify password reset form displays
   - [ ] Enter new password and submit
   - [ ] Verify success and redirect to login

3. **Security Validation**
   - [ ] Confirm no auto-login after clicking reset link
   - [ ] Verify user must enter new password
   - [ ] Confirm user is signed out after password update
   - [ ] Test with expired/invalid tokens

### Error Scenarios
- [ ] Test with invalid reset tokens
- [ ] Test with expired reset links
- [ ] Test network errors during password update
- [ ] Verify proper error messages display

## üìä Performance Impact

### Bundle Size Analysis
- New routes add ~14 kB total (compressed)
- No impact on existing routes
- Lazy-loaded components for optimal performance

### Route Performance
```
‚îú ‚óã /auth/forgot-password    6.41 kB  (static)
‚îú ‚óã /auth/reset-password     7.46 kB  (static)
```

## üîí Security Features

### Implemented Protections
- [x] No automatic login from reset links
- [x] Token validation before password updates
- [x] Immediate session cleanup after password change
- [x] Proper error handling for invalid tokens
- [x] Development-only debug logging

### Auth Context Enhancements
- [x] Password reset flow detection
- [x] Bypass redirects during reset process
- [x] Maintain security for all other flows

## üêõ Rollback Plan

If issues occur post-deployment:

1. **Quick Fix**: Disable forgot password link
   ```javascript
   // In login page, temporarily comment out:
   // <Link href="/auth/forgot-password">Forgot password?</Link>
   ```

2. **Full Rollback**: Revert to previous commit
   ```bash
   git revert HEAD
   git push origin main
   ```

## üìù Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Watch
- [ ] Password reset request success rate
- [ ] Password reset completion rate
- [ ] Error rates on new routes
- [ ] User authentication flow success

### Logs to Monitor
- Supabase auth logs for password reset events
- Application logs for token validation errors
- User feedback on password reset experience

## ‚úÖ Deployment Ready

All checks passed. The password reset functionality is ready for production deployment to Netlify.

**Deployment Command:**
```bash
npm run build && netlify deploy --prod
```

Or simply push to main branch if auto-deployment is configured.
