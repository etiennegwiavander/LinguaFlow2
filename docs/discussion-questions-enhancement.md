# Enhanced Discussion Questions System

## Overview
Transformed the generic discussion questions system into a hyper-personalized, contextual, and multilingual conversation engine that creates naturally engaging questions tailored to each student's profile and target language.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Multilingual Support**
- **Native Language Templates**: Questions are generated in the student's target language (English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese)
- **Cultural Context**: Questions consider cultural differences and perspectives
- **Language-Specific Phrasing**: Natural conversation starters that feel authentic in each language

### 2. **Topic-Specific Contextual Questions**
Instead of generic templates, questions are now contextually relevant to specific topics:

#### Food & Cooking
- "What's your favorite dish to cook?"
- "Tell me about a time when you tried [topic] for the first time?"
- "What ingredients are essential for [topic] in your opinion?"

#### Travel & Transportation
- "Tell me about a time when [topic] didn't go as planned?"
- "What's the most memorable aspect of [topic] for you?"
- "What role does technology play in modern [topic]?"

#### Technology & Social Media
- "How has [topic] changed your daily routine?"
- "What concerns do you have about the future of [topic]?"
- "How do you maintain a healthy balance with [topic]?"

#### Work & Career
- "What motivates you most about [topic]?"
- "What's the biggest misconception people have about [topic]?"
- "What role does passion play in [topic] success?"

### 3. **Hyper-Personalization**
Questions are tailored based on:
- **Student's Name**: Personal address throughout questions
- **Learning Goals**: Business, travel, academic, or general goals
- **Age Group**: Teenager, adult, or senior-specific questions
- **Grammar Weaknesses**: Targeted practice for past tense, future, conditionals
- **Learning Styles**: Visual, kinesthetic, auditory adaptations
- **Fluency Barriers**: Confidence-building or vocabulary-focused questions

### 4. **Level-Appropriate Complexity**

#### A1/A2 (Beginner)
- Simple, concrete questions
- "What three words come to mind when you think of [topic]?"
- "Do you enjoy [topic]? What makes it special for you?"

#### B1/B2 (Intermediate)
- Comparative and analytical questions
- "What's the most surprising thing you've learned about [topic]?"
- "How has your relationship with [topic] evolved since you were younger?"

#### C1/C2 (Advanced)
- Complex, philosophical questions
- "How does [topic] serve as a lens for understanding cultural values?"
- "What ethical dilemmas arise when we consider the global impact of [topic]?"

### 5. **Natural Conversation Flow**
- Questions feel like genuine conversation starters
- Avoid repetitive "What do you think about..." patterns
- Include storytelling prompts, hypothetical scenarios, and personal reflection
- Cultural bridge-building questions

### 6. **Intelligent Question Selection**
- Categorizes questions by type (personal, analytical, experiential, hypothetical)
- Ensures variety in the final selection
- Removes duplicates and maintains engagement
- Selects up to 20 diverse questions per topic

## Example Transformations

### Before (Generic)
- "What do you think about food?"
- "Do you like food? Why?"
- "How is food in your country?"

### After (Contextual & Personalized)
- "Maria, what's your favorite dish to cook, and what memories does it bring back?"
- "Tell me about a time when trying a new cuisine surprised you."
- "How do family food traditions in your culture differ from what you've seen in Spanish-speaking countries?"

## Technical Implementation

### Language Templates
```typescript
const getLanguageTemplates = (lang: string) => {
  switch (lang) {
    case "es": return {
      personalExperience: "¿Cuál ha sido tu experiencia personal con",
      opinion: "¿Qué opinas sobre",
      // ... more templates
    };
    case "fr": return {
      personalExperience: "Quelle a été votre expérience personnelle avec",
      // ... French templates
    };
    // ... other languages
  }
};
```

### Topic-Specific Generation
```typescript
const getTopicSpecificQuestions = (topic: string, templates: any) => {
  const topicLower = topic.toLowerCase();
  
  if (topicLower.includes("food")) {
    // Food-specific contextual questions
  } else if (topicLower.includes("travel")) {
    // Travel-specific contextual questions
  }
  // ... more topic categories
};
```
