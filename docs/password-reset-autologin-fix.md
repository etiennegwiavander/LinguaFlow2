# Password Reset Auto-Login Fix

## Problem Description

When users clicked on password reset links from their email, they were experiencing:

1. **First click**: "Invalid reset link" error + automatic login to their account (without password reset)
2. **Second click**: "Incomplete reset link" error + redirect to login page

This prevented users from actually resetting their passwords and created a confusing user experience.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by two main problems:

### 1. Automatic Session Detection
The main Supabase client was configured with `detectSessionInUrl: true`, which automatically detects and creates sessions from URL parameters. When users clicked reset links containing `access_token` and `refresh_token` parameters, Supabase automatically logged them in instead of treating these as password reset tokens.

### 2. Premature Token Validation
The password reset page was calling `supabase.auth.getUser()` during the validation phase, which created persistent sessions and logged users in before they could reset their password.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Specialized Supabase Client for Password Reset

Created `lib/supabase-reset-password.ts` with a specialized client:

```typescript
export const supabaseResetPassword = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey, {
  auth: {
    autoRefreshToken: false,     // Don't auto-refresh
    persistSession: false,       // Don't persist in localStorage  
    detectSessionInUrl: false,   // CRITICAL: Don't auto-detect sessions
  }
});
```

### 2. Non-Intrusive Token Validation

Modified the validation logic to only perform basic format checks without API calls:

- **Before**: Called `supabase.auth.getUser()` during validation → auto-login
- **After**: Only validates JWT format structure → no API calls → no auto-login

### 3. Deferred Session Creation

Sessions are now only created during the actual password update process:

- `createTemporaryResetSession()` - Creates session only when updating password
- `updatePasswordWithReset()` - Updates password within temporary session
- `cleanupResetSession()` - Immediately signs out after password update

## Key Changes Made

### Files Modified:

1. **`lib/supabase-reset-password.ts`** (NEW)
   - Specialized Supabase client for password reset
   - Helper functions for temporary session management

2. **`app/auth/reset-password/page.tsx`**
   - Removed premature API calls during validation
   - Uses specialized client for password updates
   - Improved error handling and user feedback

### Code Changes:

```typescript
// OLD - Caused auto-login
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.getUser(accessToken);

// NEW - No API calls during validation
if (!isValidJWTFormat(accessToken) || !isValidJWTFormat(refreshToken)) {
  // Show error without creating sessions
}
```

## Security Considerations

The fix maintains all security requirements:

1. **No Persistent Sessions**: Temporary sessions are immediately cleaned up
2. **Token Validation**: Actual token validation still occurs during password update
3. **Secure Updates**: Password updates use proper Supabase auth methods
4. **Immediate Cleanup**: All sessions are signed out after password update

## User Experience Improvements

### Before Fix:
- Click reset link → Auto-login (wrong behavior)
- Click again → "Incomplete link" error
- User never reaches password reset form

### After Fix:
- Click reset link → Password reset form appears
- Enter new password → Password updated successfully
- Redirect to login with success message

## Testing

Created comprehensive tests to verify:

1. No auto-login when valid tokens are present
2. Proper error handling for invalid/missing tokens
3. Specialized client prevents session detection
4. Cleanup functions work correctly

## Deployment Notes

This fix is backward compatible and doesn't require:
- Database migrations
- Environment variable changes
- User data modifications

The specialized Supabase client only affects the password reset flow and doesn't impact normal authentication.

## Verification Steps

To verify the fix works:

1. Request password reset email
2. Click the reset link from email
3. Should see password reset form (not auto-login)
4. Enter new password
5. Should update successfully and redirect to login

The key indicator of success is that users see the password reset form instead of being automatically logged in.
