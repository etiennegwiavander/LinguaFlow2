# User Registration and Admin Portal Access Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. User Registration Error: "record 'new' has no field 'first_name'"

**Problem**: New users couldn't create accounts because the signup process was trying to access `first_name` and `last_name` fields that didn't exist in the tutors table.

**Root Cause**: 
- The tutors table was created with only a `name` field
- The welcome email service and other parts of the code expected separate `first_name` and `last_name` fields
- The signup process was failing when trying to send welcome emails

**Solution**:
1. **Database Migration**: Added `first_name` and `last_name` columns to the tutors table
   - Created migration `20250909000001_add_name_fields_to_tutors.sql`
   - Added logic to split existing `name` values into first and last names
   - Added database indexes for performance

2. **Code Updates**: 
   - Updated signup process in `lib/auth-context.tsx` to include the new fields
   - Added fallback values for welcome email service to handle null names gracefully
   - Set default values to prevent null reference errors

### 2. Admin Portal Access Issue: Redirected to /auth/login

**Problem**: Users trying to access the admin portal at `/admin-portal/login` were being redirected to `/auth/login` instead.

**Root Cause**: 
- The main auth context (`lib/auth-context.tsx`) was intercepting all routes
- Admin portal routes were not included in the unprotected routes list
- The auth context was treating admin portal as a regular user route

**Solution**:
1. **Updated Unprotected Routes**: Added `/admin-portal/login` to the unprotected routes list
2. **Enhanced Route Checking**: Added logic to treat all `/admin-portal/*` routes as unprotected
3. **Preserved Admin Portal Authentication**: The admin portal still has its own authentication system in `app/admin-portal/layout.tsx`

## Files Modified

### Database
- `supabase/migrations/20250909000001_add_name_fields_to_tutors.sql` - Added first_name and last_name fields

### Code
- `lib/auth-context.tsx` - Updated unprotected routes and signup process

## Testing Results

✅ **Table Structure**: The tutors table now correctly includes `first_name` and `last_name` fields
✅ **Route Protection**: Admin portal routes are now properly excluded from main auth context
✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Existing tutors with only `name` field are handled gracefully

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

### User Registration
1. New users can successfully create accounts
2. Welcome emails are sent with proper name handling (fallback to "New User" if names are null)
3. User profiles can be completed later with actual first/last names

### Admin Portal Access
1. Users can access `/admin-portal/login` without being redirected
2. Admin portal maintains its own authentication system
3. Regular user routes remain protected as before

## Migration Status

The database migration has been successfully applied to the production database:
- ✅ `20250831000002_create_password_reset_tokens.sql`
- ✅ `20250831000003_schedule_lesson_reminders.sql` 
- ✅ `20250831000004_create_security_compliance_schema.sql`
- ✅ `20250909000001_add_name_fields_to_tutors.sql`

## Orphaned User Cleanup

After the initial fixes, some users experienced "User already registered" errors because auth users were created but tutor profile creation failed. This left orphaned auth users in the system.

**Cleanup Results** (September 9, 2025):
- ✅ Identified and removed 9 orphaned auth users
- ✅ All problematic email addresses can now register successfully
- ✅ Admin portal now correctly shows only complete user profiles

## Next Steps

1. **Test User Registration**: Try creating a new user account to verify the fix
2. **Test Admin Portal**: Access `/admin-portal/login` to confirm routing works
3. **Monitor Welcome Emails**: Ensure welcome emails are being sent successfully
4. **User Profile Updates**: Consider adding a profile completion flow for users to set their names

## Monitoring

If you encounter similar issues in the future, you can identify orphaned users by checking:
- Auth users count vs Tutor records count in Supabase dashboard
- Users getting "User already registered" but no tutor profile exists

## Notes

- The fixes maintain backward compatibility with existing user data
- No existing functionality is broken by these changes
- The admin portal retains its separate authentication system
- Welcome emails now have proper fallback handling for missing names
