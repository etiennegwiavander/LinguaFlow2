# Password Reset Security Fix

## Problem
The password reset functionality was automatically logging users into their accounts when they clicked the reset link in their email, bypassing the requirement to enter a new password. This created a security vulnerability where anyone with access to the reset email could gain immediate access to the account.

## Root Cause
1. **Auto-login behavior**: Supabase's `resetPasswordForEmail()` generates tokens that, when used with `setSession()`, automatically authenticate the user.
2. **Auth context redirection**: The auth context was detecting the temporary session and redirecting users to the dashboard before they could set a new password.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Modified Reset Password Page (`/auth/reset-password`)
- **Token validation without auto-login**: The page now validates reset tokens without immediately setting a session
- **Controlled session management**: Only sets the session temporarily during password update, then immediately signs out
- **Proper error handling**: Validates tokens and provides clear error messages for expired/invalid links

### 2. Updated Auth Context (`lib/auth-context.tsx`)
- **Reset page exception**: Modified the auth context to not redirect users away from `/auth/reset-password` even if they have a temporary session
- **Preserved security**: Maintains all other authentication redirects and protections

### 3. Enhanced User Experience
- **Clear flow**: Users must enter their new password before gaining access
- **Success feedback**: Shows confirmation when password is updated
- **Secure redirect**: After password update, users are signed out and redirected to login with a success message

## Security Benefits
1. **No auto-login**: Reset links no longer provide immediate account access
2. **Password requirement**: Users must actively set a new password
3. **Session cleanup**: Temporary sessions are immediately cleared after password update
4. **Token validation**: Proper validation of reset tokens before allowing password changes

## User Flow (Fixed)
1. User clicks "Forgot password?" on login page
2. User enters email address
3. User receives reset email with secure link
4. User clicks link â†’ redirected to `/auth/reset-password`
5. **User must enter new password** (security fix)
6. Password is updated and user is signed out
7. User redirected to login with success message
8. User can now login with new password

## Testing
- Build successful with no compilation errors
- All routes properly configured and accessible
- Auth context properly handles reset flow exceptions
- Password reset maintains security while providing good UX

The password reset functionality is now secure and requires users to actively set a new password before gaining account access.
