# Password Reset Security Fix

## Problem
The password reset functionality was automatically logging users into their accounts when they clicked the reset link in their email, bypassing the requirement to enter a new password. Additionally, users were being redirected back to the login page instead of seeing the reset password form.

## Root Causes
1. **Auto-login behavior**: Supabase's `resetPasswordForEmail()` generates tokens that automatically authenticate users
2. **Auth context interference**: The auth context was redirecting users before they could access the reset form
3. **Token format variations**: Supabase uses different token formats (query params vs URL fragments)
4. **Missing error handling**: Invalid tokens weren't being handled properly

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Reset Password Page (`/auth/reset-password`)
- **Flexible token detection**: Handles both query parameters and URL fragments
- **Multiple token formats**: Supports `access_token`/`refresh_token` and `token_hash` formats
- **Comprehensive debugging**: Added logging to identify token format issues
- **Error handling**: Proper validation and user feedback for invalid/expired tokens
- **Controlled session management**: Only sets session temporarily during password update

### 2. Updated Auth Context (`lib/auth-context.tsx`)
- **Password reset detection**: Identifies when users are in a password reset flow
- **Bypass redirects**: Prevents automatic redirects during password reset
- **Token-aware logic**: Checks for reset tokens in URL to determine flow state
- **Preserved security**: Maintains all other authentication protections

### 3. Improved User Experience
- **Clear debugging**: Console logs help identify token issues during development
- **Better error messages**: Specific feedback for different failure scenarios
- **Secure flow**: Users must enter new password before gaining access
- **Success confirmation**: Clear feedback when password is updated

## Technical Details

### Token Format Handling
```javascript
// Handles both formats:
// 1. Query params: ?access_token=...&refresh_token=...&type=recovery
// 2. URL fragments: #access_token=...&refresh_token=...&type=recovery
// 3. Token hash: ?token_hash=...&type=recovery
```

### Auth Context Logic
```javascript
// Detects password reset flow and bypasses normal auth handling
const isPasswordReset = path === '/auth/reset-password' && 
  (urlParams.has('access_token') || urlParams.has('token_hash'));
```

## Debugging Features
- Console logging of all URL parameters
- Token presence detection
- Error message logging
- Auth state change tracking

## User Flow (Fixed)
1. User clicks "Forgot password?" on login page
2. User enters email address
3. User receives reset email with secure link
4. User clicks link → redirected to `/auth/reset-password` (no auto-redirect)
5. **User sees password reset form** (fixed)
6. **User must enter new password** (security requirement)
7. Password is updated and user is signed out
8. User redirected to login with success message

## Testing Steps
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to login page
3. Click "Forgot password?"
4. Enter email and submit
5. Check email for reset link
6. Click reset link - should show password form (not redirect to login)
7. Enter new password
8. Should redirect to login with success message

## Build Status
✅ Build successful with no compilation errors
✅ All routes properly configured and accessible
✅ Auth context properly handles reset flow exceptions
✅ Enhanced debugging and error handling implemented

The password reset functionality now properly shows the reset form and requires users to actively set a new password before gaining account access.
