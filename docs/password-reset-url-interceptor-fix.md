# Password Reset URL Interceptor Fix

## Problem Summary

The password reset functionality had a critical security issue where users were automatically logged in when clicking reset links, bypassing the requirement to enter a new password. This happened because:

1. Supabase's `detectSessionInUrl: true` automatically processed reset tokens from the URL
2. The tokens were consumed before our page could handle them properly
3. Users were logged in immediately instead of seeing the password reset form

## Solution Implemented

### 1. URL Interceptor (`lib/password-reset-url-interceptor.ts`)

Created a new interceptor that:
- **Runs immediately** when the reset password page loads
- **Extracts tokens** from both URL search params and hash fragments
- **Cleans the URL** using `window.history.replaceState()` to prevent Supabase from processing tokens
- **Supports multiple token formats**: standard (access/refresh) and token_hash
- **Handles errors** gracefully with user-friendly messages

### 2. Clean Reset Password Page (`app/auth/reset-password/page.tsx`)

Replaced the complex existing implementation with a clean, focused version that:
- **Uses the interceptor hook** to get tokens safely
- **Prevents auto-login** by intercepting tokens before Supabase processes them
- **Validates token format** without making API calls that create sessions
- **Shows proper error states** for invalid/expired/missing tokens
- **Maintains security** by immediately signing out after password updates

### 3. Key Security Features

#### Token Interception
```typescript
// Intercepts tokens before Supabase can process them
const { tokens, hasError, errorMessage, isReady } = usePasswordResetInterceptor();

// Immediately cleans URL to prevent auto-processing
window.history.replaceState({}, document.title, cleanUrl);
```

#### Secure Password Update Flow
```typescript
// Creates temporary session only for password update
const { data: sessionData } = await createTemporaryResetSession(accessToken, refreshToken);

// Updates password
await updatePasswordWithReset(newPassword);

// Immediately signs out to prevent persistent login
await cleanupResetSession();
```

## Expected Behavior Now

### ✅ Correct Flow
1. **User clicks reset link** → Page loads with "Reset Your Password" form
2. **User enters new password** → Password is updated securely
3. **User is redirected** → To login page with success message
4. **User logs in** → With their new password

### ❌ Previous Problematic Flow (Fixed)
1. ~~User clicks reset link → Automatically logged in~~
2. ~~User sees dashboard → Without entering new password~~

## Technical Details

### Interceptor Hook
```typescript
export function usePasswordResetInterceptor() {
  const [result, setResult] = useState({
    tokens: null,
    hasError: false,
    wasIntercepted: false
  });
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const interceptResult = interceptPasswordResetTokens();
    setResult(interceptResult);
  }, []);
  
  return { ...result, isReady: true };
}
```

### Token Validation
- **JWT Format Check**: Validates standard tokens have proper JWT structure
- **Token Hash Check**: Validates token hash has minimum length
- **Error Handling**: Provides specific error messages for different failure types

### URL Cleaning
- **Immediate Execution**: Runs as soon as tokens are detected
- **Complete Cleanup**: Removes all parameters to prevent re-processing
- **History Management**: Uses `replaceState` to avoid back button issues

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suite covering:
- Token interception from search params and hash fragments
- Error handling for auth errors and missing tokens
- URL cleaning behavior
- Hook functionality and state management

## Deployment

- ✅ **Built successfully** with no errors
- ✅ **Committed and pushed** to main branch
- ✅ **Deployed to production** via Netlify

## Security Validation

The fix ensures:
1. **No automatic sessions** are created from reset links
2. **Users must enter passwords** to complete reset process
3. **Temporary sessions** are immediately cleaned up
4. **Tokens are validated** without creating persistent sessions
5. **Error states** don't expose sensitive information

This implementation fully addresses the security requirements and prevents the auto-login vulnerability while maintaining a smooth user experience.
