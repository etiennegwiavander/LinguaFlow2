# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves removing all onboarding-related code from the LinguaFlow application to prepare it for production deployment to Netlify. The application currently contains references to onboarding functionality that are incomplete or causing build issues, and these need to be cleanly removed without breaking existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove all onboarding code from the application, so that the build process completes successfully without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is built THEN there SHALL be no TypeScript errors related to undefined onboarding variables
2. WHEN the application is deployed THEN there SHALL be no runtime errors related to missing onboarding functionality
3. WHEN users access the student profile page THEN they SHALL see the interface without any onboarding elements
4. WHEN the build process runs THEN it SHALL complete successfully without warnings about unused onboarding imports

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a tutor using the application, I want the student profile interface to work seamlessly, so that I can focus on lesson planning without UI distractions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the AI Lesson Architect tab THEN I SHALL see the title without any "New!" badges or onboarding indicators
2. WHEN I navigate through the student profile tabs THEN all functionality SHALL work as expected without onboarding interruptions
3. WHEN I generate lesson plans THEN the process SHALL work without any onboarding-related UI elements

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to be deployment-ready, so that it can be successfully deployed to Netlify without build failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is built for production THEN the build SHALL complete without errors
2. WHEN the application is deployed to Netlify THEN it SHALL start successfully
3. WHEN users access the deployed application THEN all core functionality SHALL work as intended
4. WHEN the deployment process runs THEN there SHALL be no missing dependencies or broken imports
