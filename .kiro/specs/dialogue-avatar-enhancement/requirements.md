# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the dialogue sections in interactive lesson materials by replacing simple initial-based avatars with visual character avatars that reflect personality traits. The system will use the tutor's profile image for teacher/tutor characters and generate or select appropriate character avatars for other dialogue participants based on their personality characteristics.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a language tutor, I want dialogue sections to display visual character avatars instead of just initials, so that lessons are more engaging and visually appealing for my students.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a dialogue section is rendered THEN the system SHALL display visual character avatars instead of initial-based circular avatars
2. WHEN multiple dialogue lines exist THEN each character SHALL have a consistent avatar throughout the dialogue
3. WHEN a dialogue contains teacher/tutor characters THEN the system SHALL use the tutor's profile image as their avatar
4. IF the tutor does not have a profile image THEN the system SHALL use a default character avatar for the teacher/tutor role

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a student, I want character avatars to reflect personality traits and roles, so that I can better understand and connect with the dialogue participants.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN character avatars are generated or selected THEN they SHALL reflect appropriate personality traits based on the character's role and context
2. WHEN a character is identified as a teacher/tutor THEN their avatar SHALL convey authority and professionalism
3. WHEN a character is identified as a student THEN their avatar SHALL appear approachable and learning-oriented
4. WHEN characters have specific roles (e.g., doctor, customer, friend) THEN their avatars SHALL reflect those contextual characteristics

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a language tutor, I want the avatar system to work seamlessly with existing dialogue functionality, so that the enhanced visuals don't disrupt the lesson flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dialogue sections are rendered THEN all existing functionality SHALL remain intact (text display, translation, interaction)
2. WHEN avatars are displayed THEN they SHALL NOT include animated speaking indicators
3. WHEN dialogue lines are shown THEN they SHALL NOT include voice/audio playback functionality
4. WHEN avatars fail to load THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to the current initial-based display

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the avatar system to be performant and scalable, so that it doesn't impact lesson loading times or system resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN avatars are loaded THEN they SHALL be optimized for web display (appropriate file sizes and formats)
2. WHEN the same character appears multiple times THEN their avatar SHALL be cached to avoid redundant requests
3. WHEN avatar generation or selection fails THEN the system SHALL fallback gracefully without breaking the dialogue display
4. WHEN lessons are exported THEN character avatars SHALL be included in the exported content appropriately
