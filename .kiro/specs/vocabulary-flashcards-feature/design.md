### 2. Flashcard Interface

**Component**: `FlashcardInterface`
- **Layout**: Full-screen overlay with background blur for immersion
- **Animation**: Smooth transitions between cards using CSS transforms
- **Responsive**: Adapts to different screen sizes while maintaining readability

**Key Features**:
- Immersive full-screen experience with blurred background
- Card-flip animations for engaging transitions
- Touch/swipe support for mobile devices
- Keyboard navigation support (arrow keys)

**Design Decision**: Use a full-screen overlay approach to create focus and eliminate distractions, similar to modern flashcard applications like Anki or Quizlet.

### 3. Vocabulary Card Component

**Component**: `VocabularyCard`

**Structure**:
```typescript
interface VocabularyCardData {
  word: string;
  pronunciation: string;
  partOfSpeech: string;
  definition: string;
  exampleSentences: {
    present: string;
    past: string;
    future: string;
    presentPerfect: string;
    pastPerfect: string;
    futurePerfect: string;
  };
}
```

**Layout Design**:
- **Header**: Word + Pronunciation (phonetic notation)
- **Body**: Definition + Part of Speech
- **Footer**: Expandable example sentences organized by tense
- **Highlighting**: Bold formatting for target word in sentences

**Design Decision**: Organize information hierarchically with the word as the primary focus, followed by essential information (definition, part of speech) and detailed examples that can be expanded to avoid overwhelming the interface.

### 4. Navigation System

**Component**: `NavigationControls`

**Features**:
- Previous/Next arrow buttons
- Progress indicator (current position in session)
- "Continue from last memory" option on session start
- Smooth transitions with loading states

**Design Decision**: Implement bidirectional navigation to allow review of previous words, with visual feedback and progress tracking to maintain user orientation.

## Data Models

### 1. Student Vocabulary Profile

```typescript
interface StudentVocabularyProfile {
  studentId: string;
  proficiencyLevel: 'A1' | 'A2' | 'B1' | 'B2' | 'C1' | 'C2';
  nativeLanguage: string;
  learningGoals: string[];
  vocabularyWeaknesses: string[];
  conversationalBarriers: string[];
  lastSessionPosition?: number;
  seenWords: string[];
}
```

### 2. Vocabulary Session

```typescript
interface VocabularySession {
  sessionId: string;
  studentId: string;
  startTime: Date;
  currentPosition: number;
  words: VocabularyCardData[];
  isActive: boolean;
}
```

### 3. Vocabulary Generation Request

```typescript
interface VocabularyGenerationRequest {
  studentProfile: StudentVocabularyProfile;
  excludeWords: string[];
  count: number;
  difficulty?: string;
  focusAreas?: string[];
}
```

## Vocabulary Generation Service

### AI-Powered Word Selection

**Service**: `VocabularyGenerationService`

**Personalization Algorithm**:
1. **Proficiency Analysis**: Select words appropriate for student's CEFR level
2. **Native Language Consideration**: Avoid false friends and cognates when beneficial
3. **Goal Alignment**: Prioritize vocabulary that supports stated learning objectives
4. **Weakness Targeting**: Focus on areas identified as challenging
5. **Barrier Addressing**: Select words that help overcome conversational obstacles

**Implementation Approach**:
- Supabase Edge Function for AI-powered vocabulary generation
- Integration with existing AI infrastructure (similar to discussion questions)
- Caching mechanism to reduce API calls and improve performance

**Design Decision**: Leverage existing AI infrastructure and patterns established in the discussion topics feature to ensure consistency and maintainability.

### Non-Repetition Strategy

**Approach**: 
- Track seen words in session state and student profile
- Implement intelligent word selection that builds upon previous vocabulary
- Use semantic similarity to introduce related words progressively

## Session Management

### Last Memory Functionality

**Implementation**:
- Store session state in localStorage for immediate access
- Persist critical data to database for cross-device continuity
- Provide "Continue from last memory" option on session start

**Data Persistence**:
- **Local Storage**: Current session state, temporary progress
- **Database**: Long-term progress, seen words, session history

**Design Decision**: Use hybrid storage approach to balance performance (local storage) with persistence (database) and cross-device functionality.

### Progress Tracking

**Metrics Tracked**:
- Words seen in current session
- Session duration
- Navigation patterns (forward/backward usage)
- Exit points and return patterns

## Error Handling

### Vocabulary Generation Failures

**Scenarios**:
- AI service unavailable
- Network connectivity issues
- Invalid student profile data

**Fallback Strategy**:
- Cached vocabulary sets for offline functionality
- Graceful degradation with simplified word information
- Clear error messaging with retry options

### Session Recovery

**Approach**:
- Automatic session state recovery on page refresh
- Graceful handling of corrupted session data
- Fallback to new session if recovery fails

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

**Components to Test**:
- `VocabularyCard` rendering and data display
- `NavigationControls` interaction handling
- `VocabularyGenerationService` personalization logic
- Session state management functions

### Integration Testing

**Scenarios**:
- End-to-end flashcard navigation flow
- Vocabulary generation and display pipeline
- Session persistence and recovery
- Student profile integration

### Performance Testing

**Focus Areas**:
- Flashcard transition animations
- Large vocabulary set handling
- Memory usage with extended sessions
- AI service response times

**Design Decision**: Follow established testing patterns from the discussion topics feature to ensure consistency and leverage existing test infrastructure.

## Security Considerations

### Data Privacy

**Student Data Protection**:
- Vocabulary preferences stored securely
- Session data encrypted in transit
- Minimal data retention policy for seen words

### AI Service Security

**API Protection**:
- Rate limiting for vocabulary generation requests
- Input validation for student profile data
- Secure API key management for AI services

## Performance Optimization

### Rendering Optimization

**Strategies**:
- React.memo for vocabulary cards to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Virtualization for large vocabulary sets (if needed)
- Lazy loading of example sentences
- Optimized animations using CSS transforms

### Data Loading

**Approaches**:
- Prefetch next vocabulary words during current card display
- Implement vocabulary caching strategy
- Batch vocabulary generation requests
- Progressive loading of detailed word information

**Design Decision**: Apply performance optimization patterns established in the discussion topics feature, including React.memo usage and efficient state management.
