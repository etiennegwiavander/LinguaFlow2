# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Email System Validation and Deployment specification defines a comprehensive end-to-end testing, validation, and deployment process for the LinguaFlow application's email functionality. This process ensures that all email features work correctly in production, identifies and fixes any issues, and successfully deploys the application to Netlify without breaking existing functionality. The validation covers the entire email ecosystem including SMTP configuration, template management, automated email triggers, and user-facing email features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to perform comprehensive end-to-end testing of all email functionality, so that I can verify the email system works correctly before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running email system validation THEN the system SHALL test all email types (welcome, password reset, lesson reminders, admin notifications)
2. WHEN testing SMTP configurations THEN the system SHALL verify connectivity and authentication for all configured providers
3. WHEN testing email templates THEN the system SHALL validate template rendering with real data and placeholder substitution
4. WHEN testing automated email triggers THEN the system SHALL verify emails are sent at correct times with proper content
5. WHEN testing email delivery THEN the system SHALL confirm emails reach recipients and track delivery status
6. WHEN email tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and suggested fixes
7. WHEN all email tests pass THEN the system SHALL generate a validation report confirming email system readiness

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify and fix any email-related issues found during testing, so that the email system functions reliably in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN email validation identifies issues THEN the system SHALL categorize problems by severity (critical, high, medium, low)
2. WHEN critical email issues are found THEN the system SHALL prevent deployment until issues are resolved
3. WHEN fixing email configuration issues THEN the system SHALL validate fixes with automated tests
4. WHEN fixing template rendering issues THEN the system SHALL verify templates render correctly with various data scenarios
5. WHEN fixing delivery issues THEN the system SHALL test email delivery through multiple providers if configured
6. WHEN fixes are applied THEN the system SHALL re-run affected tests to confirm resolution
7. WHEN all issues are resolved THEN the system SHALL update the validation status to ready for deployment

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a deployment engineer, I want to build and prepare the application for production deployment, so that all features work correctly in the production environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN preparing for deployment THEN the system SHALL run a complete build process with production optimizations
2. WHEN building the application THEN the system SHALL verify all dependencies are correctly installed and compatible
3. WHEN building email components THEN the system SHALL ensure all email-related assets are properly bundled
4. WHEN validating the build THEN the system SHALL check that all API routes and edge functions are correctly configured
5. WHEN preparing environment variables THEN the system SHALL verify all required email configuration variables are set
6. WHEN build validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages and remediation steps
7. WHEN build is successful THEN the system SHALL generate deployment artifacts ready for Netlify

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a deployment engineer, I want to deploy the application to Netlify without breaking existing functionality, so that users can access all features including email capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to Netlify THEN the system SHALL use the validated build artifacts from the build process
2. WHEN configuring Netlify deployment THEN the system SHALL set up all required environment variables for email functionality
3. WHEN deploying edge functions THEN the system SHALL ensure all Supabase edge functions are properly deployed and accessible
4. WHEN deployment completes THEN the system SHALL verify the application loads correctly in the production environment
5. WHEN testing deployed email features THEN the system SHALL confirm all email functionality works in the production environment
6. WHEN deployment issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide rollback capabilities to previous working version
7. WHEN deployment is successful THEN the system SHALL run post-deployment validation tests to confirm all features work

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want to perform post-deployment validation of all application features, so that I can confirm the deployment was successful and no functionality was broken.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN post-deployment validation runs THEN the system SHALL test all critical user workflows (registration, login, lesson creation, email sending)
2. WHEN testing user registration THEN the system SHALL verify welcome emails are sent and received correctly
3. WHEN testing password reset THEN the system SHALL confirm reset emails are delivered and links work properly
4. WHEN testing lesson management THEN the system SHALL verify reminder emails are scheduled and sent correctly
5. WHEN testing admin portal THEN the system SHALL confirm all email management features are accessible and functional
6. WHEN validation tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed failure reports with steps to reproduce issues
7. WHEN all validation tests pass THEN the system SHALL generate a deployment success report confirming system health

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring and alerting for the email system in production, so that I can quickly identify and respond to any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the system SHALL implement monitoring for email delivery rates and failures
2. WHEN email delivery failures exceed thresholds THEN the system SHALL send alerts to administrators
3. WHEN SMTP configuration issues occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information and notify administrators
4. WHEN email templates fail to render THEN the system SHALL capture errors and provide debugging information
5. WHEN monitoring email performance THEN the system SHALL track delivery times, bounce rates, and user engagement
6. WHEN system health checks run THEN the system SHALL verify all email components are functioning correctly
7. WHEN issues are detected THEN the system SHALL provide automated diagnostics and suggested remediation steps

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a development team member, I want automated testing and validation processes, so that email functionality can be continuously verified without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code changes are made THEN the system SHALL automatically run email-related tests in the CI/CD pipeline
2. WHEN running automated tests THEN the system SHALL test email functionality across different environments (development, staging, production)
3. WHEN automated tests detect regressions THEN the system SHALL prevent deployment and notify the development team
4. WHEN email configuration changes THEN the system SHALL automatically validate new configurations before applying them
5. WHEN new email templates are created THEN the system SHALL automatically test template rendering and delivery
6. WHEN automated validation completes THEN the system SHALL generate reports showing test coverage and results
7. WHEN all automated tests pass THEN the system SHALL approve the changes for deployment to the next environment
