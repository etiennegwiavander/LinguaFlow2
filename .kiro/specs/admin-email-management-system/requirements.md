# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Admin Email Management System provides administrators with comprehensive control over all email communications sent by the application. This system centralizes SMTP configuration, enables email template customization, and provides testing capabilities to ensure emails work correctly before being sent to users. The system supports multiple email types including welcome emails, lesson reminders, and other automated communications, all manageable through the existing admin portal interface.

2. WHEN an admin selects an email provider (Gmail, SendGrid, AWS SES, or Custom) THEN the system SHALL show provider-specific configuration fields
3. WHEN an admin enters SMTP credentials (host, port, username, password, encryption) THEN the system SHALL validate and securely store these settings
4. WHEN SMTP settings are saved THEN the system SHALL test the connection and display success or error status
5. IF SMTP configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages and prevent saving

5. WHEN template changes are saved THEN the system SHALL validate HTML structure and placeholder syntax
6. WHEN a template contains invalid HTML or placeholders THEN the system SHALL display validation errors
7. WHEN templates are saved THEN the system SHALL maintain version history for rollback capability

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to test emails before making them live, so that I can verify content, formatting, and delivery work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin wants to test an email THEN the system SHALL provide a testing interface for each email type
2. WHEN testing an email THEN the system SHALL allow input of recipient email address and required parameters
3. WHEN test parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL generate a preview using actual template and data
4. WHEN an admin sends a test email THEN the system SHALL use current SMTP settings to deliver the email
5. WHEN a test email is sent THEN the system SHALL display delivery status and any error messages
6. WHEN test email delivery fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information for troubleshooting
7. WHEN test email is successful THEN the system SHALL log the test for audit purposes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to manage different types of automated emails from one interface, so that I can maintain consistency across all communications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin accesses the email management dashboard THEN the system SHALL display all email types in organized categories
2. WHEN viewing email types THEN the system SHALL show status (active/inactive), last modified date, and usage statistics
3. WHEN an admin wants to enable/disable an email type THEN the system SHALL provide toggle controls with confirmation
4. WHEN an email type is disabled THEN the system SHALL prevent automatic sending while preserving template configuration
5. WHEN managing email schedules THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of timing for automated emails (e.g., 15 minutes before lesson)
6. WHEN email scheduling is modified THEN the system SHALL update all future automated email triggers

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to monitor email delivery and performance, so that I can ensure communications are reaching users successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN viewing email logs THEN the system SHALL show recent email activity with timestamps, recipients, and status
3. WHEN email delivery fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information and notify administrators
4. WHEN bounce rates exceed thresholds THEN the system SHALL alert administrators to potential issues
5. WHEN viewing email performance THEN the system SHALL provide filtering by date range, email type, and status
6. WHEN exporting email data THEN the system SHALL generate reports in common formats (CSV, PDF)
