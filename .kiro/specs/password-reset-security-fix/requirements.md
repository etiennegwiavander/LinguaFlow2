# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current password reset functionality has a critical security vulnerability where users are automatically logged into their accounts when clicking the reset link in their email, bypassing the requirement to enter a new password. This violates security best practices and creates a potential attack vector. This feature will implement a secure password reset flow that requires users to actively set a new password before gaining account access.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user who forgot their password, I want to be required to enter a new password when clicking the reset link, so that my account remains secure even if someone else has access to my email.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks a password reset link from their email THEN the system SHALL display a password reset form requiring them to enter a new password
2. WHEN a user clicks a password reset link THEN the system SHALL NOT automatically log them into their account
3. WHEN a user accesses the reset password page with valid tokens THEN the system SHALL validate the tokens without creating an active session
4. WHEN a user successfully updates their password THEN the system SHALL immediately sign them out to prevent unauthorized access

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user attempting to reset my password, I want clear feedback about the status of my reset link, so that I understand whether the link is valid and what actions I need to take.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the reset password page with invalid or expired tokens THEN the system SHALL display an "Invalid reset link" error message
2. WHEN a user accesses the reset password page with missing tokens THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messaging
3. WHEN a user successfully updates their password THEN the system SHALL display a success confirmation message
4. WHEN a user encounters an error during password reset THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages to help them understand the issue

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user who has successfully reset their password, I want to be redirected to the login page with confirmation, so that I can immediately sign in with my new credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully updates their password THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the login page
2. WHEN a user is redirected after password reset THEN the system SHALL display a success message indicating the password was updated
3. WHEN a user reaches the login page after password reset THEN the system SHALL allow them to sign in with their new password
4. WHEN a user completes the password reset flow THEN the system SHALL ensure no active sessions remain from the reset process

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the password reset flow to handle different token formats securely, so that the system works reliably across different email providers and URL formats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system receives reset tokens in query parameters THEN it SHALL process them securely without auto-login
2. WHEN the system receives reset tokens in URL fragments THEN it SHALL process them securely without auto-login
3. WHEN the system receives token_hash format tokens THEN it SHALL process them securely without auto-login
4. WHEN the system processes any token format THEN it SHALL validate the tokens before allowing password updates

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and debugging capabilities for the password reset flow, so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid tokens are encountered THEN the system SHALL log appropriate error information for debugging
2. WHEN token validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages to users
3. WHEN the password reset flow encounters errors THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without exposing sensitive information
4. WHEN debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logging of the reset flow process
